            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello and welcome to my personal website! My name is Jarne, and I'm passionate about technology, programming, and creating digital experiences that make a difference. This website serves as both a portfolio and a window into my interests, projects, and journey in the world of web development and data visualization.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Currently, I'm exploring the fascinating world of data visualization using libraries like D3.js, which allows me to transform complex datasets into meaningful and interactive visual stories. I believe that good design and intuitive user interfaces can make technology more accessible and enjoyable for everyone. My background spans across various programming languages and frameworks, with a particular focus on JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and modern web development practices.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When I'm not coding, you'll find me staying up-to-date with the latest tech trends, experimenting with new tools and frameworks, or working on personal projects that challenge my creativity and problem-solving skills. I'm particularly interested in the intersection of technology and user experience, always striving to create solutions that are not only functional but also beautiful and user-friendly.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This website represents my journey in web development and serves as a platform to share my projects, thoughts, and experiences.
