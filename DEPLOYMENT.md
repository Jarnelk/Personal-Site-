## üêõ Troubleshooting

If your site doesn't load:

2. Verify all file names are lowercase
3. Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
4. Wait up to 10 minutes for changes to propagate
5. Clear browser cache and try again

If images don't load:
1. Verify image files are in `assets/images/` folder
2. Check that file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
3. Ensure images are web-optimized (JPG/PNG, <500KB)

If links don't work:

2. Verify file names match exactly
3. Test navigation locally first
